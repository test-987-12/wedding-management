2. Abstract
This proposal presents a Wedding Management System specifically designed for
Bangladeshi weddings. Our system aims to simplify the complex process of wedding
planning by consolidating essential features such as user dashboards, event planning with
timelines, budget management, guest list tracking, vendor coordination, and task
management into one easy-to-use platform. Additionally, we have incorporated advanced
features including virtual wedding invitations, a secure photo & video gallery, a theme &
style planner, automated checklists and reminders, and a guest QR code check-in system
for efficient management of large guest lists. The backend is developed using and
Python, Django with the flexibility to integrate APIs if needed. This system not only
enhances the overall planning experience but also respects the cultural nuances of
Bangladeshi weddings. Our goal is to provide a modern solution that reduces stress and
streamlines every step of the wedding planning process.
3. Acknowledgment

6. Introduction
Background and Problem Statement:
Weddings in Bangladesh are celebrated with rich cultural traditions that involve
numerous events and require careful planning. Coordinating vendors, managing a large
guest list, tracking the budget, and scheduling various tasks can be overwhelming for
couples and organizers. Traditional planning methods often fall short in addressing these
challenges effectively.
Motivation:
Our project is motivated by the need to create a digital solution that caters specifically to
the unique requirements of Bangladeshi weddings. By integrating both core
functionalities and innovative features, we aim to streamline the planning process, reduce
stress, and ensure that every aspect of the wedding is managed efficiently.
Objectives and Scope:
• Develop a user-friendly web-based platform.
• Integrate core features like dashboards, event timelines, budget management,
guest list and vendor management, and task tracking.
• Implement advanced features including virtual invitations, multimedia
galleries, theme planning, automated checklists, and a guest QR code check-in
system.
• Respect cultural traditions while leveraging modern technologies for
enhanced planning.
7. Literature Review
Recent research and market trends highlight a growing demand for digital event
management tools. Many existing wedding planning solutions, however, cater
predominantly to Western traditions and do not address the specific needs of South Asian
weddings. While several applications offer individual functionalities like vendor or guest
management, few provide an integrated platform that combines all essential features with
culturally relevant enhancements. Our project is innovative in that it not only brings

together a comprehensive set of tools but also tailors the experience to the unique
customs of Bangladeshi weddings.
8. Methodology / Implementation
Technologies & Tools:
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
• Backend: Python, Django (with potential API integrations as required)
• Database: A relational database system (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL)
Implementation Steps:
1. Requirement Analysis:
• Conduct surveys and discussions with potential users and wedding
planners to gather detailed requirements.
2. System Design:
• Develop the overall system architecture and design user-friendly
interfaces.
• Create workflow diagrams and system architecture diagrams
3. Development:
• Build core modules such as the user dashboard, event planning, budget
management, guest list management, vendor management, and task
management.
• Implement advanced features including virtual wedding invitations,
photo & video gallery, theme & style planner, automated checklists
with reminders, and the guest QR code check-in system.
4. Testing:
• Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to
ensure the platform meets all functional and performance
requirements.
5. Deployment & Maintenance:
• Deploy the system on a web server and plan for regular updates and
maintenance based on user feedback.

9. Innovation & Uniqueness
Our Wedding Management System distinguishes itself by combining essential wedding
planning tools with advanced, culturally tailored features. Key innovative aspects
include:
• Cultural Customization: The platform is designed specifically for
Bangladeshi weddings, accommodating traditional events and customs.
• Guest QR Code Check-in: An innovative solution to efficiently manage large
guest lists, reducing wait times and streamlining event entry.
• Integrated Approach: By merging functionalities like budgeting, vendor
coordination, scheduling, and digital invitations into one platform, our system
offers a seamless planning experience.
• Robust Backend: Using Python, Django, and API's ensures high performance
and flexibility, with the ability to integrate APIs if necessary.
10. Results & Discussion
Expected Results:
• A fully functional and integrated Wedding Management System that meets
the diverse needs of Bangladeshi weddings.
• A user-friendly interface that simplifies the planning process for couples,
wedding planners, and vendors.
• Improved efficiency in guest management through the use of QR code
technology.
Discussion:
During the development phase, we will continuously test and refine each module to
ensure system reliability and a smooth user experience. The integration of multiple
programming languages will be managed carefully to maintain efficient communication
between different components. Feedback from initial testing will be used to address any
challenges and further enhance the system’s performance.

11. Applications & Future Scope
Real-World Applications:
• The system will serve as an essential tool for planning weddings in both
urban and rural settings across Bangladesh.
• It will be particularly useful for wedding planners, couples, and vendors
looking to streamline the coordination and management of wedding events.
Future Scope:
Looking ahead, we intend for the Wedding Management System to grow internationally,
extending its reach beyond Bangladesh. With further development, the platform can be
adapted to cater to weddings in other countries, incorporating additional features and
customizations to suit various cultural contexts.
12. Conclusion
In conclusion, the Wedding Management System is an innovative digital solution
designed to address the complex and unique challenges of planning Bangladeshi
weddings. By integrating essential planning tools with advanced features such as virtual
invitations and a guest QR code check-in system, our platform promises to streamline the
entire wedding planning process. This project not only enhances operational efficiency
but also respects and embraces cultural traditions, setting a new standard for wedding
management. We are excited about the potential impact of our system and its future
growth, both locally and internationally.
